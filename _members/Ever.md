description: "I’m co-advised by Willow Coyote-Maestas and [Robert Stroud](https://msg.ucsf.edu/people/robert-stroud-ma-phd). I am combining high throughput mutational scanning with biochemical and biophysical assays to study the mechanistic effects of mutations on transporters. In undergrad, I did my undergrad thesis with [Randy Stockbridge](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/randystockbridge/), where I did structural and functional characterization of small multidrug resistant transporters. I’m now interested in using chemotherapeutic resistance as a model for studying substrate specificity. I think transporters are really neat :)"
