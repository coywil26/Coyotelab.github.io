description: "Noah received his Bachelor's in Biophysics from Harvard University. He then
worked at the Broad Institute, where he analyzed DNA sequencing data to identify the 
genomic drivers that separate low-grade and high-grade brain cancers. Following his work at the Broad, he 
received his Ph.D in Cancer Biology from Stanford University, where he was co-advised
by [Mike Angelo](https://www.angelolab.com/) and [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html). 
While at Stanford, Noah developed machine learning tools to profile highly-multiplexed imaging data. 
He then used these tools to characterize the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer patient samples,
combining this spatial information with paired DNA and RNA sequencing data to predict patient response to immunotherapy.

In the Coyote-Maestas lab, Noah will be using deep mutational scanning to understand the cross talk
between cancer and immune cells."
