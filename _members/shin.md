description: "Catherine attended Simon Fraser University for her undergraduate studies and worked in the [Warren lab](https://warrengroup.weebly.com) investigating redox reactions in the blue copper protein azurin. For her PhD, she is co-mentored by [Dr. Brian Shoichet](https://bkslab.org) and studies the mechanism of ligand-dependent GPCR activation to develop better therapeutics. When she is not thinking about science, Catherine enjoys taking photos, listening to podcasts, and visiting the different store cats throughout the city."
