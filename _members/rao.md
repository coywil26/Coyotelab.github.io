description: "Jingyou is a student visitor from UCLA. Back home, she is a PhD student in the Computer Science department under [Dr. Harold Pimentel](https://pimentellab.com/). Her primary research focuses on developing statistical and computational methods for functional genetic assay data, but she also enjoys pipetting at the bench from time to time. During her visit, she is motivated to learn more about protein science, and to identify problems that align with the interests of both worlds."
